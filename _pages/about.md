<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is **Shaoyu Liu**, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate jointly trained by **Xidian University** and the **Qiyuan National Laboratory**, with an expected graduation year of 2027. My advisors are Professor **Guanghui Zhao** (Xidian University) and Professor **Xiangyang Ji** (Qiyuan Lab, Tsinghua University). To date, I have published one first-author paper at **CVPR** and have another paper under review at **NeurIPS**. During my studies, I was awarded the Qiyuan National Laboratory Academic Scholarship.
I developed the first event-based vision multimodal large language model, **EventGPT**, which has garnered widespread attention both domestically and internationally (including recognition from the Robotics and Perception Group led by **Davide Scaramuzza** at the University of Zurich, as well as Arizona State University, among others). It was featured in a dedicated article titled **"EventGPT: Giving AI the Power of Superhuman Vision"** by the U.S. developer platform PromptLayer.

My primary research interests include multimodal large language models, neuromorphic vision, robotics and perception, and related fields.ns"></a>).
